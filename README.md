# Exploring Toronto Apartment Building Characteristic
## Overview
This paper analyzes the relationship between building characteristics such as year built, number of units, number of storeys, and property type and their impact on building evaluation scores. Using data from OpenDataToronto, visualizations and statistical models to reveal trends in how these variables interact, showing that older buildings typically have fewer units and storeys compared to newer ones. Visualization shows that property type also influences building evaluation scores and development patterns over time. These findings provide significant insights into urban development trends and building performance, offering valuable implications for future real estate planning and infrastructure management.
